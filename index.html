                REPORT DATE: 10/6/2006 <br>
                CASE FILE: 41D-0021 <br>
                STATUS: ACTIVE AND WANTED <br>
                THREAT LEVEL: <span class="important">EXTREME</span> <br>
            </p>

            <p>
                PREAMBLE: Following an incident on an unspecified date, the entity designated "Aidsnal" has been
                classified as a Class 5 Anomalous Threat. All personnel are advised to maintain extreme caution. Do not
                approach. Report all sightings immediately to Command Structure.
            </p>

            <h4>PHYSICAL DESCRIPTION:</h4>
            <p>
                Aidsnal typically manifests as a humanoid mimic, closely resembling a young adult male of slightly
                chubby build.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Appears to have short hair, color inconsistent but often reported as dark.</li>
                <li>Usually observed wearing an orange T-shirt, black pants, and black shoes.</li>
                <li>A digital watch is frequently noted on the left wrist.</li>
                <li>Default facial expression is consistently reported as a wide, unsettling smile.</li>
                <li>Visual documentation attempts (photographs, video) invariably result in extreme blurring, attributed
                    to the entity's rapid movement.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                NOTE: Despite the consistent visual description, the entity's true nature or form is unknown. The
                mimicry may be a tactic.
            </p>

            <h4>BEHAVIORAL PATTERNS:</h4>
            <p>
                Highly elusive and non-confrontational in direct interaction, yet its mere presence is demonstrably
                detrimental.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Known for exhibiting extreme bursts of speed, making observation and pursuit impractical.</li>
                <li>Prefers dark, enclosed spaces or areas with low human traffic, often near points of entry/exit.</li>
                <li>No known attempts at verbal or non-verbal communication have been recorded.</li>
                <li>Statistically correlated with increased reports of unexplained missing persons and deaths in areas
                    proximate to suspected activity.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>KNOWN INCIDENTS:</h4>
