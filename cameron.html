                        <p class="post-summary">Stopped by the bar and met a new pal.</p>
                        <p class="post-full-text hidden">You get used to seeing the same faces in Townscale. Obviously
                            you can say the same thing for a lot of places, but Townscale is quite a small one. So, when
                            I saw a new guy hunched over a coffee, it definitely stood out. I just got my usual, didn't
                            really think anything of it, but then he dropped his keys and I helped him pick them up.
                            Small talk, you know? Turns out he's pretty new to Townscale, seemed a bit anxious, kept
                            looking over his shoulder. Didn't pry, but he seemed interesting. Might see him around
                            again.</p>

                        <h3>Perimeter Breach Protocol 7.0 (and why it sucks)</h3>
                        <p class="post-meta">Logged on March 2, 2014 by Cameron</p>
                        <p class="post-summary">Another day, another update to Protocol 7.0. You'd think after three
                            revisions, they'd get it right. Spoiler: They haven't.</p>
                        <p class="post-full-text hidden">Seriously, who designs these things? Protocol 7.0, the latest
                            iteration of our esteemed Perimeter Breach Response, just got another "optimization." What
                            that means for us on the ground is more steps, more redundant checks, and a higher chance of
                            user error when the real thing hits. They added a mandatory biometric scan at Tier 2
                            escalation, which sounds great until you realize the scanners have a 15% false-negative rate
                            on cold mornings. Cold mornings are like 90% of mornings in Townscale. So now, when an alarm
                            goes off, I get to choose between letting a potential threat through or having a
                            twenty-minute standoff with a frozen fingerprint reader. And don't even get me started on
                            the new drone deployment parameters. "Automated flight paths" my ass, my drone nearly took
                            out a random bush last week trying to navigate the "optimized" route. We need practical
                            solutions, not just more layers of worthless horseshit. Rant over.</p>

                        <p class="post-meta">Logged on February 2, 2014 by Cameron</p>
                        <p class="post-summary">It was a bit lonely, but nice nonetheless.</p>
                        <p class="post-full-text hidden">I likely won't be doing this type of post every year (not that
                            active on social media anyway), but today I celebrated my 20th birthday with a co-worker.
                            We've known each other for a while and she wanted to surprise me after work. We went out to
                            eat outside of town to a nice place, we both ordered a steak. We didn't talk as much as I
                            had hoped sadly, but I thanked her for it anyway. It was nice, but I'll admit, a part of me
                            wishes I could celebrate my birthdays with more people, maybe even my family if they decide
                            to visit (or if I visit them). Is it selfish to want more people to recognize you? Oh well,
                            it was better than nothing.</p>

                        <p class="post-summary">Sometimes, you need that silence</p>
                        <p class="post-full-text hidden">Every day when I walk home from work, I stare at the horizon
                            and see the burning ball of flame slowly going down. I'm not sure if it's normal, but I tend
                            to think about what life has been like for me thus far whenever I see it. It makes me reflect
                            on my past, what it's like right now, and what it could be tomorrow. In other words, I
                            really like sunsets. Also, I've noticed that sunsets look prettier in Winter. Still not sure
                            why, it could be the humidity, but either way it's nice to see.</p>

                        <h3>Vinyl Find</h3>
                        <p class="post-meta">Logged on October 29, 2013 by Cameron</p>
                        <p class="post-summary">Stumbled upon a gem at the flea market today.</p>
                        <p class="post-full-text hidden">You wouldn't think Townscale would be a hotbed for obscure
                            stuff like this, but every now and then, it coughs up a surprise. Today's find: a
                            first-press of "Aurora Rift" by Bin Central. It's an instrumental synthwave album. The vinyl
                            itself is a bit scratched, and there's a noticeable crackle, but it's fine. It's got that
                            raw energy that you just don't hear in modern electronic music. Sometimes, these small
                            discoveries are what keep you sane out here.</p>
